          <h3>Welcome Vistors,</h3>
          <p>
            I would like to welcome you to my E-Portfolio web site. On this site you will find
            background information about myself, work history, educational background and
            samples of some of my best work over the years. This site was aimed to be a
            supplement to my resume given to potential employers.
          </p>
          <p>
            My name is Tony Hall and I am a professional developer. I graduated from Pennsylvania College of Technology in
            2011, obtaining a Bachelor of Science Degree in Web &amp; Applications Development along with minors in Business
            Administration and Sociology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deciding to pursue minors in Business Administration and Sociology was just as important to me as my major. By
            obtaining a minor in Business Administration I will be familiar with the operations of business and could contribute
            to future advancement in any business I will work for in the future. My minor in Sociology is personally my most
            important field of study because of its real world application. It has always been a personal responsibility of mine
            to be aware of events in society and it is something that will always peak my interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            My professional career started with Social and Scientific Systems Inc in 2012 as a Programmer. My work involved
            developing application which were used for data collection and reporting for the then National Children's Study.
            During my time there I was exposed to a great deal of professional experiences and learned a great deal from the
            team of developers, project managers and business professionals I worked alongside during my time there.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Spring of 2015, I made the next step in my career by joining ATTAIN LLC as a Senior Consultant within the
            National Cancer Institute (NCI). At NCI, I work with other developers, researchers and scientists to develop
            various small scale web applications which aid the cancer researchers with their studies. At this point I
            have been exposed to a great deal of new web and statistical technologies, while also being able to use certain
            technologies I became familiar with from my previous position.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was born in Washington D.C. and raised in Silver Spring, MD. As the son of two Jamaican immigrants, I have
            inherited a great work ethic and passion for anything that I pursue.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have always had an interest in computers and gained an interest specifically in the web development field early in
            high school. The constantly changing technology in this field will insure that there will always be something new to
            learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am determined to pursue and have a successful career in supporting great causes that have a positive effect in
            peoples lives while utilizing and constantly expanding my web development skill set. Be sure to check out some of my code samples and check back often as I continue to update my portfolio. You can connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out to me via E-Mail.

            Building Python scripts that are used as web services to communicate between the front end and 'R' scripts. I've also
            used python to assist with reading and retrieving data from the file system and modifying images. More recently I've | been experimenting with how to use Slush to build base projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am constantly trying to learn how to code smarter and more efficently. Which to me means utilizing technology to do | repetative tasks so that I can focus on other aspects of development. I find tools like Jade, Stylus and Gulp to be
            very useful in that aspect and I will continue to use them and other technologies along the way to becoming the best | developer that I can be.

          <h3>Jade Templating</h3>View Jade templates<a href="#" target="_blank"> code sample</a> on my GitHub
          <h4>Brief Intro to Jade</h4>
          <p>
            Jade (recently renamed to Pug) is a templating engine that once compiled, outputs HTML code.
            It uses a tabbed based struture to determine the heirarchy of the html file.
          </p>
          <h4>Advantages to using Jade over plain HTML</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Maintainable.</b>Building Jade temnplate allows you to organize the code by being able to separate code in blocks
              or separate files. Coding one base index html file can become tedious therefore separating the code logically brings
              some structure to the code base. Then  once you are ready to build the base index html file you can just include
              multiple jade files in one file, which once compiled will give you the index file with all the page
              elements where you want them.
            </li>
            <li><b>Keeping things DRY.</b>If you are like me then you don't like repeating yourself. As a developer, if you are building the same
              code repeatedly then you are doing something wrong. With jade you can have one code snippet for example let's say a header
              or footer that you can keep in a separate file and then reuse across different jade files by including it within the other
              files.
            </li>
            <li><b>Less Code.</b>Because the syntax of Jade removes the need for certain elements that would be required in a HTML file, you are left with
              a shorter document overall that is easier to read and maintain.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Gulp.js</h3>View Gulp.js<a href="#" target="_blank"> code sample</a> on my GitHub
          <h4>What is Gulp and why use it?
            <p>
              Gulp is a javascript task runner that uses streams to complete various tasks
              based on almost anything you want the task to do.
              Tasks can be set up to conduct automated testing, minifying files, structuring projects,
              compiling those Jade files above and much, much more.
            </p>
            <p>Gulp and other task runners (Grunt being another one) allows developers to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Automate redundant development tasks and decrease setup times for new projects</li>
              <li>Utilize various node packages on the files run through the tasks</li>
              <li>Keeps the file structure organized so that the developer doesn't even have to think about it</li>
              <li>Add a very powerful utility to the developers tool belt</li>
            </ul>
